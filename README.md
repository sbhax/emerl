*By* ***SBHAX***

#### A set of tools for working with the Sonic Battle ROM (US) and similar, coded with Deno and JS

## Summary

</div>

Emerl is designed to provide basic and efficient command line tools for dumping and working with data directly from the Sonic Battle ROM file. It provides some possibly universal classic ROM tools too.

## Current tools

</div>

- **JSON Dump/Patch** - Work in progress tool to provide a way to 'map' out values from ROMs according to a JSON and then to dump them into another JSON (dump.json). The original part of the project but it's quickly showing it'll not be flexible enough for our needs. Currently functions for dumping.
